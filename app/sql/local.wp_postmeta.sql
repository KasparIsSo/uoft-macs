(251,85,"content_1","The study of the ancient Mediterranean world has been both enriched and complicated by the diversity of cultures and states that occupied its shores throughout antiquity, and the huge range of evidence those cultures and states left behind. This diversity has led to the development of distinctive standard methodologies operating within sub-disciplines.\r\n\r\nOur collaborative specialization exposes doctoral students to the full range of current research questions and methods in Mediterranean archaeology. The Mediterranean has been a key testing ground for many innovations in the field of archaeology, while the sheer intensity of exploration in the Mediterranean ensures the region’s continued relevance in the wider world of archaeology. Yet, this weight of research, especially with its distribution across so many research traditions, makes navigating the ancient world of the Mediterranean especially complex. One of its great strengths—the richness of its textual sources—is also its Achilles heel, as it has generated some deep-rooted scholarly assumptions about what kinds of histories we can build with, or without, textual evidence. For much of the Mediterranean past, we are faced with a ‘prehistoric’ record, without textual evidence – or, in some cases, with only administrative ‘laundry lists’; therefore, the narratives for these periods are based largely on archaeological datasets. However, mid-way through the first millennium BC the proliferation of various forms of textual evidence allows for quite different kinds of ‘historical’ accounts of society and its economic organization, political institutions, and religious beliefs. This deep qualitative difference in the evidence for ‘prehistoric’ and ‘historic’ periods has created entrenched disciplinary divisions not only in the methods employed but also the questions deemed relevant. The unique opportunities for long-term histories that the Mediterranean offers have thus remained largely unrealized."),

(255,85,"content_2","Yet this scenario of a ‘great divide’ has come under scrutiny in recent years. Ancient historians increasingly recognize that historical and art historical accounts of textual, visual, and material culture can be strengthened by the integration of archaeological methods. Moreover, study of the later prehistoric periods (such as Neolithic and Bronze Age) has now matured to a state where it no longer has to contend with only being ‘prehellenic’ or ‘pre-Homeric’, and can more positively explore long-term patterns that might stretch into the Iron Age. A new generation of students is being trained in how to combine the strengths of both archaeology and ancient history in order to carry out transversal research that stretches across some of these boundaries. The challenges in doing so are not trivial, however – to work with ancient texts requires quite a different skill set from excavation, or ceramic analysis. Yet, the rewards are worth it, because what we can see within this emerging framework is a fresh vision for how to think about the deep history of the ancient Mediterranean world.\r\nThe extent of the challenge requires a concerted interdisciplinary and collaborative effort to overcome these differences and establish a common platform. By bringing together the skills and experiences of faculty from Classics, Art, Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, Anthropology, and The Study of Religion we can forge a unique blend of expertise and guidance for students in this new specialization. No such specialization currently exists in Canada, and yet a new generation of students is emerging with BAs in Classics, Art History, and Archaeology, and interested in pursuing just this kind of transversal research that cuts across domains.\r\n\r\nOur academic objectives are to expose students to the range of current approaches on the cutting-edge of Mediterranean archaeology. From Braudel (/La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l’époque de Philippe II,/1949), to Horden and Purcell (/The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History/, 2000), and now Broodbank (/The/ /Making of the Middle Sea/:/A History of the Mediterranean from the Beginning to the Emergence of the Classical World/, 2013), the merits of applying archaeological evidence to the reconstruction of long-term histories are clear. The Mediterranean offers unrivalled opportunities for exploring the complexities of economic, social, political and religious change over centuries and millennia, across a vast region that does behave in some ways as a ‘unit’, and yet is incredibly diverse with innumerable micro-ecologies. We are not the first to recognize this potential, as the Mediterranean has long been a testing ground for new ideas and methods in archaeology. Yet, there is still so much more that can be done, especially across disciplinary and methodological divides."),

Ancient historians increasingly recognize that historical and art historical accounts of textual, visual, and material culture can be strengthened by the integration of archaeological methods.

A new generation of students is being trained in how to combine the strengths of both archaeology and ancient history in order to carry out transversal research that stretches across some of these boundaries. The challenges in doing so are not trivial, however – to work with ancient texts requires quite a different skill set from excavation, or ceramic analysis.

(688,167,"content_1","All candidates must fulfill the admissions criteria and degree requirements of the unit in which they are enrolled. Candidates indicate in their application to the School of Graduate Studies that they wish to be considered for the Collaborative Specialization. Once admitted to the home program, candidates will then also have their applications reviewed by the <i>MACS</i> committee, and successful candidates will be notified by the Specialization Director. Students do also have the possibility to apply to the Collaborative Specialization once registered in one of the home units, up until the end of their second year of study.  \r\n\r\nStudents must complete a year–long core course, which in all five core units can be counted as an elective, and a fieldwork requirement, which is additional to unit requirements. The core course, Methods in Mediterranean Archeology (1.0 FCE) will consist of 24 weekly classes, split into four blocks of six classes with the following themes: landscape, settlement and demography; technology and economy; connectivity and networks; art and religion. A range of relevant faculty will give classes within each of these blocks, chosen so as to maximize the temporal and spatial breadth encountered within each theme, and to expose students to the range of methods utilized (for example the use of archaeological intensive survey to reveal landscape use, and how epigraphy is used to reconstruct aspects of demography). With the diachronic occupation of a number of key sites in the Mediterranean, special foci on individual sites, such as Knossos, will be an invaluable strategy. Students will be assessed through writing assignments, seminar presentations, and in-class participation. Grades will be on the graduate letter grade scale as indicated by the University Assessment and Grading Practices Policy and deadlines for coursework also follow unit and SGS deadlines. The course will typically be taken in the first or second year of the program. PhD students from participating units will have priority, though it will also be open to students from other units, contingent upon approval from the Specialization committee.\r\n\r\nThe aim is for the student through the Methods in Mediterranean Archaeology course to develop a critical understanding of what constitutes method within the different domains of Classical archaeology, ancient history, and prehistory, and the challenges and opportunities in working across these methods to produce new frameworks for researching the ancient Mediterranean. \r\n\r\nThe fieldwork requirement is four weeks on an archaeological project in the Mediterranean, which can be excavation, survey, or a study season. Students will take part in projects run by core faculty from participating units. No prior fieldwork experience is expected or required – the necessary skills will be taught as part of the fieldwork. The fieldwork requirement will be run as a CR/NCR course; students will be required to demonstrate participation and submit a fieldwork daybook to the Specialization committee for assessment and feedback in line with the assessment of student performance in placements policy. Efforts will be made to accommodate students who cannot fulfill the fieldwork requirement for whatever reason. Fieldwork will be funded through a combination of project budgets and scholarships, with no ancillary fees; it will be cost neutral to the student. Faculty have a good track record of success in securing funding for their fieldwork, and already take doctoral students to the field in ongoing projects.\r\n\r\nThe dissertation topic will be in the area of Mediterranean archaeology/ ancient history/Classical archaeology. The advisory committee will include at least one graduate faculty member affiliated with <i>MACS</i>, and students are encouraged to seek representation on the committee from outside the home unit. Before the thesis defense, all students are required to present a dissertation colloquium where the originality of their research is open to scrutiny before the dissertation is examined.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specialization requirements listed above, students will have the opportunity to take part in a Mediterranean Archaeology proseminar series, which launched in September 2017. The proseminar series, which features monthly talks, will provide the opportunity for faculty and students to come together on a regular basis. Attendance will be optional but encouraged.
